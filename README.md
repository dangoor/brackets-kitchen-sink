## Brackets "Kitchen Sink" Example Extension
This extension isn't intended to be useful to end users.  It's intended to be an example extension that shows as many features and modules as possible in a working extension so that potential extension authors can see Brackets in action.

The extension is very open to Pull Requests as I intend it to be a collaborative effort with the already terrific community of Brackets and Brackets extension authors.

The basic rules for submitting a Pull Request are as follows:

* New functionality is typically driven off the top-level menu for the extension.  If your example is command driven, add a submenu item to the main extension menu.
* Code should be well documented.
* Code should be reasonably free of Linting problems.
* If your example demonstrates specific text formatting, consider including a sample document which you load with appropriate text/code that illustrates your example.
* Make sure any code you do not own the copyright to is properly attrbuted and/or complies with the license of the source.

**Note**: the extension is only a barebones clone of the "Hello World" example from the Brackets website... *for now*.  Until it has a little more *meat* I am not going to upload it to the Brackets Extension Registry.  In the meantime you can import the extension into Brackets from URL: 

1. Open `Extension Manager` in Brackets
1. Click the `Import from URL...` button in the lower-left corner
1. Enter the URL of this repo: `https://github.com/m0j0r1s1ng/brackets-kitchen-sink`


Feel free to log issues, submit pull requests or email me (email address is in the package.json) with questions, additions or ideas for this extension.
